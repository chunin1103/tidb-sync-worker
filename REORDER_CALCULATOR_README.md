## 📋 Overview

The Reorder Calculator is a CSV-based system that applies decision tree logic to calculate reorder quantities for products. It supports:

- ✅ CSV upload (no manufacturer table dependency)
- ✅ Automated reorder quantity calculations
- ✅ Clarification questions when logic is unclear
- ✅ Manual edit tracking for continuous improvement
- ✅ Oceanside Glass rules (0.35 years target)
- ✅ Bullseye Glass rules (0.25/0.40 thresholds + cascade logic)
- ✅ Cascade Report CSV export (Bullseye only)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User uploads CSV (without reorder_quantity column)
       ↓
Flask processes CSV → SQLite temp database
       ↓
Decision engine calculates reorder quantities
       ↓
Questions generated (if needed) → Client answers
       ↓
Export CSV with calculated reorder_quantity column
       ↓
User can edit manually → Re-upload to track changes
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Upload (377 Products)

1. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   https://gpt-mcp.onrender.com/reports/reorder-calculator
   ```

2. **Upload CSV:**
   - File: `Production/Edhoy Warehouse Cutsheet for Shawn - Sheet1.csv`
   - Manufacturer: Oceanside Glass (default)

3. **Expected Result:**
   - Processing completes in 5-10 seconds
   - Redirects to questions page (if any) OR download page
   - Should calculate reorder quantities for products with `Years_in_Stock < 0.35`

### Test 2: Verify Calculations

**Sample Product (from CSV line 2):**
- Product: "Oceanside Glass Almond Opalescent Frit COE96 - Medium Grain"
- Purchased: 15 units/year
- Quantity in Stock: 6 units
- Years in Stock: 6/15 = 0.4 years

**Expected Calculation:**
- Since 0.4 >= 0.35 (target), reorder_quantity should be **0** (no reorder needed)

**Sample Product (from CSV line 4):**
- Product: "Oceanside Glass Almond Opalescent, 3mm COE96 - Size 6"×12""
- Purchased: 5 units/year
- Quantity in Stock: 0 units (ZERO STOCK!)
- Years in Stock: 0/5 = 0 years

**Expected Calculation:**
- Target: 0.35 years × 5 units/year = 1.75 units
- Deficit: 1.75 - 0 = 1.75 units
- Reorder Quantity: **2 units** (rounded up)
- Reason: "URGENT: Zero stock, needs 2 units to reach 0.35 years"

### Test 3: Question Flow

Products with `Purchased = 0` (never sold) should generate HIGH priority questions:

**Expected Question:**
- Priority: HIGH
- Question: "Product '...' has never sold. Should we stock it?"
- Suggested Answer: "No (wait for first sale)"

### Test 4: Download CSV

After processing, download the CSV and verify:

**New Columns Added:**
- `Years_in_Stock` - Calculated metric
- `Reorder_Quantity` - Calculated reorder amount
- `Reorder_Reason` - Explanation for calculation
- `Calculation_Details` - JSON with breakdown

## 📊 Decision Tree Logic (Oceanside)

**Source:** `Production/wiki/02_Business_Rules/Years_In_Stock_Thresholds.md`

**Thresholds:**
- **Target:** 0.35 years (128 days)
- **Lean:** 0.20 years (73 days)
- **Well-Stocked:** 0.40 years (146 days)

**Formula:**
```python
years_in_stock = quantity_in_stock / purchased

if years_in_stock >= 0.35:
    reorder_quantity = 0  # Already at target
else:
    target_quantity = purchased * 0.35
    deficit = target_quantity - quantity_in_stock
    reorder_quantity = math.ceil(deficit)  # Round up
```

**Special Cases:**
1. **Purchased = 0** → Generate question (no sales history)
2. **Quantity = 0** → Mark as URGENT
3. **Reorder > 2 years worth** → Generate MEDIUM priority question

## 📊 Bullseye Glass Cascade Report

When manufacturer is "Bullseye Glass", a cascade report is automatically generated alongside the standard output.

### Thresholds

| Threshold | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Order trigger | 0.25 years (91 days) | Below this → order needed |
| Order target | 0.40 years (146 days) | Order enough to reach this |

### 5-Step Cascade Algorithm

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start: Load Family Inventory] --> B[Step 1: Cascade from Existing Inventory]
    B --> C{Any size below 0.25yr?}
    C -->|No| D[No order needed]
    C -->|Yes| E[Step 2: Calculate deficit to reach 0.40yr]
    E --> F[Step 3: Order Full/Half Sheets]
    F --> G[Step 4: Cascade from New Order]
    G --> H[Step 5: Verify all sizes ≥ 0.40yr]
    H --> I[Output: Sheets to Order/Cut/Save]
```

### Cutting Yields

| Sheet Type | Yields |
|------------|--------|
| 3mm Full Sheet | 6× 10x10 + 2× 5x10 |
| 2mm Half Sheet | 2× 10x10 + 2× 5x10 |
| 2 Half Sheets (3mm) | = 1 Full Sheet equivalent |

### Cascade Options (DOWN only)

| From | To | Ratio |
|------|-----|-------|
| 10x10 | 5x10 | 1:2 |
| 10x10 | 5x5 | 1:4 |
| 5x10 | 5x5 | 1:2 |

### Data Requirements

CSV must include these columns for cascade to work:

| Column | Required | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Product_Name | ✓ | Must contain size (Half Sheet, 10x10, 5x10, 5x5) OR thickness (3mm/2mm) |
| Vendor_SKU | ✓ | Bullseye format: `XXXX-YYYY-F-FULL` or `XXXX-YYYY-F-HALF` |
| Products_Parent_Id | Recommended | Groups products into families. If 0, uses SKU color code |
| Quantity_in_Stock | ✓ | Must be real inventory (not 150000 placeholder) |
| Purchased | ✓ | Annual sales volume |

**Note:** Products with `Quantity_in_Stock >= 75000` are skipped (parent/placeholder products).

### Cascade Report Output Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Parent_ID | Product family identifier |
| Product | Base product name |
| Thickness | 2mm or 3mm |
| Flag | URGENT / REORDER / WATCH |
| Sheets_to_Order | Total sheets to order |
| Sheets_to_Cut | Sheets to cut into smaller sizes |
| Sheets_to_Save | Sheets to keep as Half (uncut) |
| Order_Steps | Cascade decisions made |
| All_Above_04 | Yes/No - validation check |
| *_Before_Stock/Years | Inventory before cascade |
| *_After_Stock/Years | Inventory after cascade |

### Flag Priority

| Flag | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| URGENT | Zero stock + no source material + high volume (≥100/yr) |
| REORDER | Zero stock OR below 28 days critical threshold |
| WATCH | Below 91 days (0.25yr) target |

## 📋 Questions Dashboard

**URL:** https://gpt-mcp.onrender.com/reports/reorder-calculator/questions

The Questions Dashboard provides a centralized view of all clarification questions across all calculation sessions.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Default Filter** | Shows only **Pending** questions (unanswered) |
| **Status Filter** | Pending Only / Answered Only / All Questions |
| **Priority Filter** | HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / All |
| **Stats Cards** | Shows overall totals (not filtered counts) |
| **Clean Duplicates** | Button to remove duplicate questions |

### Filter Options

| Filter Value | URL Parameter | Shows |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Pending Only | `?answered=no` | Questions awaiting client answer (default) |
| Answered Only | `?answered=yes` | Questions already answered |
| All Questions | `?answered=all` | Both pending and answered |

**Example URLs:**
```
# Default - pending only
https://gpt-mcp.onrender.com/reports/reorder-calculator/questions

# Show all questions
https://gpt-mcp.onrender.com/reports/reorder-calculator/questions?answered=all

# Show only HIGH priority pending
https://gpt-mcp.onrender.com/reports/reorder-calculator/questions?answered=no&priority=HIGH
```

### Duplicate Question Cleanup

Questions can be duplicated when the same calculation is run multiple times. The deduplication system handles this:

**Cleanup Logic:**
1. Groups questions by `(product_id, field_name)`
2. If any in group is **answered** → keeps answered, deletes pending duplicates
3. If all are **pending** → keeps most recent, deletes older duplicates

**How to Clean:**
1. Go to Questions Dashboard
2. Click "🧹 Clean Duplicates" button
3. Confirm the action
4. Page reloads with duplicates removed

**Prevention:**
- New questions are automatically skipped if an answered duplicate already exists
- Prevents creating questions for already-resolved issues

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing required columns"
**Solution:** Ensure CSV has these columns:
- `Product_Name`
- `Product_ID`
- `Purchased`
- `Quantity_in_Stock`

### Error: "Database not configured"
**Solution:** Run `python init_reorder_schema.py` to create tables

### Error: "Session not found"
**Solution:** Sessions expire after download. Re-upload CSV.

### Calculations seem wrong
**Verification Steps:**
1. Check `Purchased` column (should be annual units sold)
2. Verify `Years_in_Stock` = `Quantity_in_Stock` / `Purchased`
3. Check target threshold (Oceanside = 0.35 years)
4. Review `Calculation_Details` column in exported CSV
