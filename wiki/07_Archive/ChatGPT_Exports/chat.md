this is data from 3 chats I have done a lot of work on. I want you do organize and memorize or do whatever you can do or needs to be done for me to be able to upload an oceanside file and have you produce the custom work order for me. Please complete this in as much detail and possible. When you are done let me know and I will upload a file for us to test

You said:
what are lines in the export file inventory details rows 33-43 weird
You said:
choose 10 parents with lots of cutting for examples and make me a workorder file of just 10
You said:
we need to make an update to the permanent rules

in the 10 parent sample picks tab I see that the doner child 154199 is displayed twice. if you need to pick a total of 5 sheets of 154199 there is no reason to list it twice on the picks tab.  any picks child duplicates can be combined,  does this make sense to you?
You said:
how many times were there duplicates in picks in this file Download the full work order
You said:
were there any examples where you decided to leave us with an inventory of 0 in the largest size because it was better to cut and have 0 large sheets and advantageous to have the smaller sheets
